# Stereochemistry and Conformation
Interactive tools to help students learn aspects of conformation and stereochemistry in organic chemistry
# Webpages
The webpage for working out cyclohexane conformations is https://stuartlw.github.io/Stereochem-Conformation/Ring/ <br>
The webpage for R/S Cahn Ingold Prelog Rules and Newman projectiosn is https://stuartlw.github.io/Stereochem-Conformation/Stereochemistry/

# Background
These tools are aimed to help students work interactively to help their understanding of Chan-Ingold-Prelog definitions of R and S configurations and also to translate Newman projections to skeltal type drawings.
The second tool lets student transfer between 2D representations of cyclohexane rings and chirconformational represntations and suggest which is lower in energy


# Developers
The pages were developed by Nimesh Mistry and Jamie Ridley.
