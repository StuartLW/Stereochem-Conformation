# NMR
Interactive webpage to practice NMR multiplet questions, develoepd at the University of Leeds, UK
# Webpages
The main NMR multiplet quizes are here: https://stuartlw.github.io/NMR/NMR.htm
A second simple simulator ( currently 400MHz only) is here: https://stuartlw.github.io/NMR/NMR2.htm

# Background
These webpages are designed as a learning tool to help students master the identification of multiplicities and the measurement of coupling constants in proton NMR spectroscopy.
Multiplets are defined by the instructor in the simple Data.csv file who defines the difficulty level and then the multiplet in the standard reporting format -(delta, mult, J)
Students then select a level and are served with the image of a multiplet to measure at a particular field strength.  They enter their answer.  The system draws what they have defined and then marks it as correct or tells them they have got it wrong.  After 5 attempts the students can ask for the answer.

An alternative page will just draw a multiplet as defined by the user (currently only) at 400MHz - this is useful if students want to compare a multiplet with a multiplet in a lab spectrum.

# Developers
The pages were developed by Stuart Warriner and Jamie Ridley.
